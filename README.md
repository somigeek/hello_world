# hello_world
I am glad to begin this journey of eating code,life without code is boring and hard.Coding is success and success is coding
i would wish to advice my fellow lazy code engineers,just like the way you think about preparation and cooking rice,the same similar procedure applies in understanding code.
let code for life
